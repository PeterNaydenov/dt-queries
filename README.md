# DT Queries

*Under heavy development*

Set of DT-toolbox query functions. You can use them for **learning purposes** or inspiration for how to build your own query functions for DT-Toolbox.


## How to use the library

Library is a list of functions and you can take only the needed one.

```js
import dtbox from 'dt-toolbox'
import { identical } from '@peter.naydenov/dt-queries'

const dt = dtbox.init ( a ) // a is some standard JS object
const result = dt.query ( identical, otherDtObject )  
// 'identiacal' query function expect one extra argument, that should be a dt-object
```
